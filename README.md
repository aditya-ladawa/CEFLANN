CEFLANN : A Profitable Buy/Sell Trading Signal Generator Powered by Neural Networks
• Developed CEFLANN (Computationally Efficient Functional Link Artificial Neural Network) using Moore's
Penrose generalized inverse matrix with regularization to generate optimal weights for input features.
• Uses highly nonlinear functions to introduce non linearity in input features.
